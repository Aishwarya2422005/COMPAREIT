Good quality product
Design looks good.....working best .. processor speed is also good..little larger in size so little difficult to use one handly.....33 watt charger is also missing which is not available on Flipkart as well as brand site which I think is a big issue....what is the use of mobile without charger. Cmf team suggest to buy 45 watt charger or 65 watt charger .......but why we buy a 45 watt or 65 watt charger because this device only support 33 watt charging. 45 watt charger is price of 1999 and 65 ...

Something Unique in Budget !!!
Pros:
Super Clean Nothing OS 2.6 without bloatwares
Unique Design and Modular
Quite decent gaming performance (BGMI gives around 35-40 FPS on max settings of HDR Ultra)
Very bright 120Hz AMOLED display
Battery is also long lasting (charging control also provided to protect battery life)
Comes with a basic screen protector installed


Cons:
No charging adapter in the box (1 star less for that)
The phone is somewhat heavy and not ideal for extended use.
You can't even setup the phone unless yo...

Awesome
Got the phone today and initial impression very cool
Nice design phone
I have used nothing phone 2 so ui and os experience is as smooth as stock
Performance is very good for normal usage
Camera looks decent for the price
We don't need a back case and feeling nostalgic using a phone with out a case after so many years
I will update my review after a month but looks definitely worth for the price
Only suggestion is accessories seems to be costly and if it's priced under 1k could be worth

Brilliant
Okay don't know why some people saying camera is not good. I must say one of the best camera I have ever used. I'll update more pic in future. Performance is good. Genshin run on low smoothly..
New update fixed the front camera too much photoshop.
